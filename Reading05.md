### ***Chapter 10***
# Introducing CSS

* Css allows you to give your webpage a unique and pleasant appearance. 

## Understanding CSS:
### ***Thinking Inside the Box*** 
To start formating your webpage imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

### BLOCK & INLINE ELEMENTS
* *** Block level *** elements look like they start on a new line.
Examples include the <h1>-<h6>, <p> and <div> elements.
* *** Inline elements *** flow within the text and do not start on a new
line. Examples include <b>, <i>, <img>, <em> and <span>.

## CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements

A CSS rule contains two parts: a *selector* and a *declaration*.

## CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a *property* and a *value*, separated by a colon.

### There are three ways to apply CSS to HTML:
1. **Inline** : plonked straight into the HTML tags using the style attribute.
2. **Internal** : styles are used for the whole page. Inside the head element, the *style* tags surround all of the styles for the page. 
3. **External** : External styles are used for the whole, multiple-page website. There is a *separate CSS file*.
