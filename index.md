## Mastering Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way of controling the web pages presentation, it is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:
1. Gists
1. Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
1. Files with the .md or .markdown extension

### Examples of what can I do: 

* I can make lists with stars 

- Dashes are working well 
  - sub points too
  
  



```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/OlaDaoud/Reading_notes/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
