I think it’s my inability to use – and stay in – a growth mindset that keeps me from heading home smiling more often. If we can get better at catching ourselves in those moments when our brains revert to a fixed mindset, we can pull ourselves back into growth-iness and ultimately be more successful.

**Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset** 

Challenges

When I’m faced with a challenging coding problem, I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it. So, lately, I try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When I’m ready, I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward. Soon enough , I begin to find root causes of the problem. 

Obstacles

His solution is to stand up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of you, walk away, and return when you’re feeling more inspired. Now, granted, this isn’t often a viable option for projects at work, but just recognizing what’s happening helps me make peace with it, and usually un-traps just enough of my gumption to do one more thing on the project.

The temptation to stay in bed is strong, strong, strong – curse you, instant gratification monkey – but I also know the feeling won’t last and I’ll feel guilty later, as always. I’m proud of myself, and that goes a long, long way. I make a conscious effort to stop and think about the growth mindset.

Where I once saw more successful managers, I now see peers with skills that complement mine, and together we’re doing some of the best work of our lives. You see, this is the growth mindset at its finest. Where a fixed mindset leads you to see the success of others as a threat, the growth mindset encourages you to see the success of coworkers as an inspiration. It might not be possible to retrofit a company to have a similar level of openness and commitment to authenticity, but it’s not too hard to adopt the growth mindset concepts to influence peer interactions. 

Growing at work, and outside work too

I’ve been guilty of having a fixed mindset far too often, and I’m working to change that. Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective. A growth mindset opens me up to more creativity and possibility, and I discover I’m able to achieve more and set higher goals.
